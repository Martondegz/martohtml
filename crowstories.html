                        <p>A crow, wandering the streets, came upon a big old jug. She peeped inside and saw there was some water in it, but try as she might she could not get her head down into the jug far enough to reach the water. As the crow knew very well that water is scarce, she could not just give up on it, and she hit on a clever plan. Using her beak, she started picking up pebbles from the ground all around and dropping them into the jug. Each pebble that dropped into the jug made the water rise just a tiny bit, and bye and bye, the level rose high enough for her to quench her thirst.
