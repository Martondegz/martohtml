                                    <p>A guard dog and a cock had been living on a farm for some considerable time, and had become good friends. One day they decided they would like to see the world and they set out together. As night fell, they found a nice tree where they decided to spend the night. The cock flew up into the branches and was soon fast asleep. The dog settled in the hollow trunk below.

At the first crack of dawn, the cock woke up, and crowed loudly. After all, it had been his job for years to wake up everybody on the farm, and one day on the road had not changed his habits. Just down the road a fox was resting, and hearing the cock crowing, thought this would make a good breakfast for him. So he stood under the tree, and called up to the cock. “What a lovely voice you’ve got, Mr Cock”, the fox said. “Why don’t you come down from your high perch so that we can get acquainted?”

The cock smiled. “I should love to get acquainted, Mr Fox”, he said. “My servant is sleeping at the foot of the tree, do wake him, and ask him to let you in”. The greedy fox could already taste the cock, and knocked on the tree trunk, waking the guard dog. The dog too, remembered his duties from his time at the farm, and seeing the fox, jumped on him and tore into him.</p>
